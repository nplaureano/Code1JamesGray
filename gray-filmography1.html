		<h2 style="color: pink; font-family: trebuchet ms">Little Odessa (1994)</h2>

			<p style="color: white; font-family: trebuchet ms; padding-left: 100px">After graduating from film school at USC, Gray went on to make his first feature, the crime drama <em>Little Odessa</em>. Though a box office failure, the film garnered critical acclaim and earned Gray the Silver Lion, the Venice Film Festival's prize for directing.  </p>

			<p style="color: white; font-family: trebuchet ms; padding-left: 100px">The film follows a hit-man who must return to his hometown and reckon with the damage his choices have done to his family. </p>

			<p style="color: white; font-family: trebuchet ms; padding-left: 100px"><em>Little</em> Odessa established several hallmarks of Gray's work: Gray would return to the film's Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, setting in <em>The Yards</em> and <em>Two Lovers</em>; the film's focus on crime would eventually carry over to Gray's next two films, <em>The Yards</em> and <em>We Own The Night</em>; and, most important, <em>Little Odessa</em> eschews hip, ironic modes of storytelling in favor of a more classical, melodramatic register.  </p>

		<h2 style="color: pink; font-family: trebuchet ms">The Yards (2000)</h2>

			<p style="color: white; font-family: trebuchet ms; padding-left: 100px">Gray's second consecutive crime film, <em>The Yards</em> explores corruption within the railway industry of New York's outer boroughs.  </p>

			<p style="color: white; font-family: trebuchet ms; padding-left: 100px"><em>The Yards</em> established Gray's long-term collaboration with actor Joaquin Phoenix. It also marked the first of two collaborations with Mark Wahlberg. </p>

		<h2 style="color: pink; font-family: trebuchet ms">We Own The Night (2007)</h2>

			<p style="color: white; font-family: trebuchet ms; padding-left: 100px">Gray's third consecutive New York-set crime film and his second consecutive collaboration with Phoenix, <em>We Own The Night</em> examines brothers (played by Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Wahlberg) on opposite sides of the law during the War on Drugs of the 19980s.  </p>

			<p style="color: white; font-family: trebuchet ms; padding-left: 100px">Like Gray's previous films, <em>We Own The Night</em> contains scenes of intense, unfiltered emotion. Also common to Gray's oeuvre is the film's reliance upon literature (Shakespeare's <em>Henry</em> IV was a source of inspiration) and opera.  </p>

		<h2 style="color: pink; font-family: trebuchet ms">Two Lovers (2008)</h2>	

			<p style="color: white; font-family: trebuchet ms; padding-left: 100px">The third of four collaborations with Joaquin Phoenix, <em>Two Lovers</em> nonetheless represented a departure for Gray. Having established himself as a well-regarded artist—if not a box office whisperer—Gray at last had the clout in Hollywood to move beyond genre films, which are easier for studios to market and sell.  </p>

			<p style="color: white; font-family: trebuchet ms; padding-left: 100px">Based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's <em>White Nights</em>, <em>Two Lovers</em> finds Leonard Kraditor suicidal after his fiancé broke off their engagement. He soon meets Sandra, the daughter of his father's colleague and who his parents hope for him to marry. However, Leonard becomes infatuated with Michelle, his across-the-alley neighbor, and begins juggling two love affairs. An intimate portrayal of the tension between desire and family expectations, <em>Two Lovers</em> was Gray's strongest film to date. </p>

		<h2 style="color: pink; font-family: trebuchet ms">The Immigrant (2014)</h2>

			<p style="color: white; font-family: trebuchet ms; padding-left: 100px">Perhaps the culmination of the themes and interests laid out in his first five films, <em>The Immigrant</em> was also Gray's most personal film to date. Largely based on his own the lives of his own grandparents, who immigrated to the United States from Russia in the 1920s, <em>The Immigrant</em> follows Ewa Cybulska's (Marion Cotillard) descent into a life of squalor after arriving at Ellis Island in 1921. </p>

			<p style="color: white; font-family: trebuchet ms; padding-left: 100px">Though the film references classics like Coppola's <em>The Godfather, part II</em> and Kazan's <em>America America</em>, Gray drew inspiration from more than just classic film. Here Gray's obsession with opera is more evident than at any prior time. "I wanted the film to feel like a lost Puccini opera," Gray said on <em>The Charlie Rose Show</em>.  </p>

		<h2 style="color: pink; font-family: trebuchet ms">The Lost City of Z (2017)</h2>

			<p style="color: white; font-family: trebuchet ms; padding-left: 100px">Based on David Grann's nonfiction book of the same name, <em>The Lost City of Z</em> chronicles three-and-a-half decades in the life of Percy Fawcett, a British explorer at the turn of the 20th century. In the film, Fawcett becomes obsessed with finding a lost city in the Amazon rain forest, which he calls Z (pronounced the British way, "zed"). The film is Gray's largest, most ambitious production to date. </p>
